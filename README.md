# OmniBOR Specification

This repository contains the OmniBOR specification, which is the formal
definition of the OmniBOR standard, intended to enable the consistent,
reproducible recording of inputs to builds which produce software
artifacts.

## Format

This standard is intended to be written according to the guidance from
the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) for writing
standards. ISO's [guide to writing standards][iso_guide] is available to
review, as is a [model manuscript of a draft ISO standard][iso_model]
("The Rice Model").

## Contributing

Work on the OmniBOR specification is overseen by the OmniBOR Working
Group. If you are interested in contributing to OmniBOR, we recommend
the following:

- Opening an Issue or a Discussion to share your perspective on a
  proposed change, or an issue you've identified in the specification.
- Participating in discussion with respondents to the issue.
- Joining in on the weekly OmniBOR Working Group meetings, where open
  issues for the specification can be discussed.

## Code of Conduct

All participants in the OmniBOR project, including anyone communicating
in the OmniBOR Issue Tracker or Discussions, in the OmniBOR Slack channel,
participating in an OmniBOR Working Group meeting, or contributing to any
OmniBOR repository, must abide by the requirements of the project's
[Code of Conduct][coc].
