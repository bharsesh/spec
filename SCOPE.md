# Scope

Specifies procedures for constructing and conveying artifact trees, directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), and other related 
data structures for artifacts.  Including but not limited to:

- formats for artifact identifiers
- formats for specifying graph relationships between artifacts
- manner of embedding identifiers for artifact trees, directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), and other related 
data structures in artifacts of various types
- guidance for build tools for:
  - constructing artifact artifact trees, DAGs, and other related data structures
  - conveying artifact trees, DAGs, and other related data structures
  - embedding identifiers for artifact trees, DAGs, and other related data structures ids in artifacts
  - manners of conveyance of artifact trees, DAGs, and other related data structures
  - descriptions of use cases for which artifact trees, directed acyclic graphs, and other related data structures may be used
  - guidance on metadata which references artifact trees, DAGs, and other related data structures
