data structures for artifacts.  Including but not limited to:

- formats for artifact identifiers
- formats for specifying graph relationships between artifacts
- manner of embedding identifiers for ADGs, and other related
data structures in artifacts of various types
- guidance on metadata which references ADGs, and other related data structures
- guidance for build tools for:
  - constructing ADGss, and other related data structures
  - conveying ADGs, and other related data structures
  - embedding identifiers for ADGs, and other related data structures ids in artifacts
  - manners of conveyance of ADGs, and other related data structures
  - descriptions of use cases for which directed acyclic graphs, and other related data structures may be used
